# Longhorn Network

**Longhorn Network** is a Java-based simulation of a social platform tailored for university students. Built as part of UT Austin's ECE 422C coursework, the project models dynamic student interactions through roommate matching, internship referrals, and real-time communication.

## 🌟 Features

- **Stable Roommate Matching**  
  Uses the Gale-Shapley algorithm to form stable roommate pairs based on mutual preferences.

- **Internship Referral System**  
  Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the strongest connection paths to students with relevant internship experience.

- **Weighted Social Graph**  
  Students are represented as nodes in a graph, with edge weights reflecting shared traits like majors, internships, or roommate history.

- **Multithreaded Interaction**  
  Simulates concurrent friend requests and chat messages using Java multithreading with thread-safe operations.

- **Interactive UI (Swing)**  
  Visualizes the graph structure and relationships through a basic Java Swing-based user interface.

## 🧠 Technologies

- Java (core logic, data parsing, multithreading)
- Swing (graphical interface)
- Graph theory: Dijkstra’s and Prim’s algorithms
